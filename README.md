# NYC-2015-Tree-Census-Data-Analysis

The New York Street tree data collected in 2015 by NYC Parks & Recreation personnel and volunteers, as well as other groups. It includes information about the tree’s health status, total count, problems that come, and location, among other things. 
We used this data to conduct an in-depth analysis with Tableau and create an interactive dashboard with Tableau Desktop that displays numerous characteristics linked to these trees, including borough-by-borough tree species, count, health, and problem. This dashboard has a side bar style with a side Filter pane for user input and a primary Data panes to represent the visual plots and relevant textual associated with the inputs.
